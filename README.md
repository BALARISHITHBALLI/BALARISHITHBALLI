- âš¡ Fun fact: The First Computer Virus Was Created as a Prank, The first computer virus, known as the "Creeper virus," was created in the early 1970s by Bob Thomas, an engineer at BBN Technologies. It was designed as an experimental self-replicating program that displayed the message, "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" It wasn't malicious and didn't cause any damage. The Creeper virus was followed by the "Reaper" program, which was created to remove the Creeper virus, making it the first antivirus software.
